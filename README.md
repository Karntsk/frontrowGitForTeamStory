2. Then suddenly, a **dragon** appeared… but maybe it was actually a **robot**?  
   (Nobody is sure yet.)

3. The scientist bellowed a crucial revelation, yet not a soul recorded it.  

4. Subsequently, the group became utterly disoriented—perhaps even inexplicably teleported—only to stumble upon a **treasure chest**…

5. Someone found a map, but it had no directions.  
   (TODO: add an image of the map?)  

6. “Let’s go to space!” shouted the pirate (although there was no pirate before this).  

7. A rocket blasted off, but at the same time the **time machine** broke down,twisting time and space together into a swirling vortex.

8. The cat was supposed to talk here, The cat said "We have to walk through the forest to reach the exit door."

9. In the forest, the detective discovered… something.  
   (What did they find?)  

10. The ending… well, we don’t really have one. Please fix this.
